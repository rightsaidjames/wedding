Instead of a traditional department store wedding list we've decided to make an [Amazon Wish List](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/registry/wishlist/GJLCRFRZ7WPB/) of suggested gifts. You can browse this list for ideas, then buy a gift from Amazon or elsewhere. If you buy an item from a website other than Amazon, please click the 'Buying this gift elsewhere?' link to remove it from the list.

When ordering online, if you are attending the wedding (and are able to carry gifts) please have them delivered to you and bring them along on the day. Otherwise they can be sent to either Anna's parents' address or Anna and James' flat. Both addresses can be found in the invitation.

We have been defeated in our effort to find a suitable dinner service online, but still would like to have one. If you would like to contribute to the 'Wedding Dinner Service Fund', rather than purchasing anything from our wish list, please indicate this on any monetary gifts.

Alternatively if you're the creative sort we'd love for you to make us a gift!

*We will be adding a few more items to the wish list before October, but it is mostly complete. If you have any issues with the list please contact us.*
